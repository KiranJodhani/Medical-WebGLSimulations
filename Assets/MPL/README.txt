-2- QUICK START GUIDE -2-

a) Drag and drop the StreamingAssets folder (located in the MPL folder) to your root Asset directory. If a 
	StreamingAssets folder already exists in your root Asset directory (from another Performance 
	Library asset, for example), just drag and drop the .mp4 file into the existing folder.
b) Navigate to "MPL > MRCSPlayback > Prefabs" and drag the HoloVideoExamplePrefab 
	object into your Hierarchy
c) With the HoloVideoPreviewPrefab selected in your Hierarchy, locate the Holo Video Object script in the Inspector.
	In the URL field, type the name of your Performance Library .mp4 file located in the StreamingAssets folder. 
	Make sure to include the .mp4 file extension at the end of the URL field.
d) Click the play button to see your Hologram come to life!

The demo scene contains a prefab you can reference if you need help getting started. The URL field in the Holo Video Object
script should look something like this: "Jim_Upbeat_Talking.mp4"
