Thank you for purchasing the "Science Lab - Ring Stand Set" pack from KittandaDesign

This is a simple asset pack that contains 8 prefabs from meshes created by me. 

I have set up the prefabs in the Prefab folder for you to drag and drop into your scenes. 

Models
-----
The models are scaled to real world scales according to my online research.

Pivots are baked and UVs are unwrapped

Textures
--------
I have set up the materials for the prefabs using a Standard Specular setup using the maps:
Albedo, AO, Emission, Normal, Specular
There are also the maps for: Basecolor, Metallic, Roughness, if you want to set up differently

The glass elements were set to standard specular with a transparent rendering mode. If you set them to fade, they will work with less specularity if you need to reserve some processing.

Scripts
-------

I wrote a Controller Script for the experience called "ExampleSceneController" and is used to run the example scene. All it does is rotate the center display area if there is a object to display and houses a number of Arrays that you can populate with things you want to display. Feel free to use this code and the objects I have added to the scene for your own work if you choose. 

If you have any questions do not hesitate to contact me as I am always happy to create more materials for my 
models or work on commissions!

Hope you have a great day further!
